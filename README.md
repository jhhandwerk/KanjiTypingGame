# KanjiTypingGame

I am trying to work out the same Kanji typing game I put together 
with JavaScript in Python. Right now I am just working on getting 
the logic to work in the terminal, but hopefully i can get it up and 
running as a web app with Django or something along those lines. 
It would also be nice if it could connect to a DB and keep score 
records and make study reccomendation/ give performance feedback.
